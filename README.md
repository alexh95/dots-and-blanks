# dots-and-blanks

This is a small puzzle game build around using dominoes pieces. This is my first game in godot and it also serves as an intro to it.

## Roadmap:
	
### Road to 0.1 - core features
- [x] Domino pieces
- [x] Grid, snap pieces to a square grid
- [x] Fullscreen
- [x] Support for resizing the window
- [x] Collisions, detect if a new piece would collide with existing ones and how to handle it
- [x] Removing domino pieces
- [x] Resetting the board
- [ ] Detect if the side of a piece matches the dot values and only allow placement in that case

### Road to 0.2 - design experimentation
- Try game rules and see where they lead

### Road to 0.3 - TBD
